# Tuberculosis-Data-Analysis-Prediction
Welcome to my Data Analytics Project that focuses on the trends of Tuberculosis. This looks into the concept of Machine Learning Models used and more importantly how each ML Models contribute to provided a generalized score. This typically shows the comparison in which model does a better job in provided a high accuracy in the test and train set scores. Please feel free to view my work and inspect the ipynb file that looks into the Tuberculosis_Dataset.csv file.

## Viewing the CSV File
I have got the dataset from Kaggle and was not able to upload it here (Big file) so I will provide the link to it. It's great practice and really emphasizes me to learn more in Machine learning and contribute to providing statistical work
